    Write a few sentences about something you did during your ordinary day.  


    Which one of these simple event of the day had an odd moment? Or
    evoked an emotion such as aggravation, frustration, surprise,
    miscommunication.  **Name the emotion.**


    What were you trying to achieve?  What did you want?


    What was stopping you from getting what you wanted?  Was the block
    internal or external?


    Why was this important to you?  **Was there a backstory** that would
    help us understand why this is so important?


    What **lesson** did you learn from all of this?


    What **change** can we make in our lives from here on?
