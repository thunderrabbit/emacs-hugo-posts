Hey Rob

17:19pm 10 April 2021

How's stuff?

I am really proud of you for prepping so hard for your walk.  I
presume it went wonderfully!  Were you able to do a candle meditation
each day?

Anyway, right now I am writing this on my Lemur, and about to do some
blending of hardlinks and such to make things hopefully make more
sense.

There are four (4) places for these files to be used.  Emacs and Atom,
both on Lemur and Macbook Pro.

This file is on both Lemur and Macbook Pro.

* Lemur at ~/.emacs.d/modes/hugo/templates/README.ROB
* MBP at ~/.emacs.d/personal/hugo/templates/README.ROB

I am about to create some hardlinks of this file and some of the
template files.

17:24pm Okay, I have just pushed this to the repo and am now writing
on my Macbook Pro.  I wrote the date and faked the date above.

Plan: hardlink the template files (used in
`~/barefoot_rob/generate_events.pl`) to `~/barefoot_rob/templates/`,
with the hope that (will not make Hugo mad and) will allow the
`generate_events.pl` to work on both MBP and Lemur machines.

Steps:

* determine what files to link
* hardlink them on Lemur from this repo to `/home/thunderrabbit/barefoot_rob/templates/`
* push this repo
* push ~/barefoot_rob repo
* pull the repo on Lemur
* pull ~/barefoot_rob repo on MBP
* erase one copy and re-hardlink the files together on MBP
* push everything (should be no changes)
* change one thing (push and make sure it shows up everywhere)

Ready?  Go!

17:30pm files to link on MBP (via `~/barefoot_rob/generate_events.pl`):

    /home/thunderrabbit/.emacs.d/modes/hugo/templates/event_weekly-alignment_template.txt
    /home/thunderrabbit/.emacs.d/modes/hugo/templates/event_walking_meditation_template.txt
    /home/thunderrabbit/.emacs.d/modes/hugo/templates/niigata_2021_walking_update.txt

((17:34 Aha!  This is the very problem.  The above URLS are on Lemur, not on this machine.   Okay back to Lemur we go...))

17:35 okay on Lemur again now, about to create hardlinks from the files above to ~/barefoot_rob/templates/

    ln /home/thunderrabbit/.emacs.d/modes/hugo/templates/event_weekly-alignment_template.txt /home/thunderrabbit/barefoot_rob/templates/event_weekly-alignment_template.txt
    ln /home/thunderrabbit/.emacs.d/modes/hugo/templates/event_walking_meditation_template.txt  /home/thunderrabbit/barefoot_rob/templates/event_walking_meditation_template.txt
    ln /home/thunderrabbit/.emacs.d/modes/hugo/templates/niigata_2021_walking_update.txt /home/thunderrabbit/barefoot_rob/templates/niigata_2021_walking_update.txt

17:46 Done creating hardlinks on Lemur.
